The output *-anaylsis.json has properties:
- "definition_line" in the objects contained in property "memory_regions"
- "line_number" in the objects contained in property "sections_and_paragraphs"

These numbers should contain the line where the variables are referenced.
The actual numbers contained are wrong. 
Check the logic and fix the bug.
