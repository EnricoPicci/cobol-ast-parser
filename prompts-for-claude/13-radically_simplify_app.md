This app has a CLI with 4 commands.

Now your task is to radically simplify it. In particular:
- the only command to be kept is `paragraph-variables-map`
- you have to remove all teh code that is not used by this command
- then you have to remove all the tests that cover the code you have removed
- then you have to remove all the documents in the folder "claude_generated_docs" and generate a new document that describes the strategy that this simplified app implements
- then you have to review all the rest of the documentation and align it to the new simplified app logic
