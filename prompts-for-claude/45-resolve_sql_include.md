check whether the api resolve_copybooks resolves also EXEC SQL INCLUDE instructions

# Response
No, resolve_copybooks does not resolve EXEC SQL INCLUDE statements.                                                              
                                                                                                                                   
  The copy resolver (CopyResolver in src/preprocessor/copy_resolver.py) only handles standard COBOL COPY statements. The regex     
  pattern at line 70-77 specifically matches:                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
  COPY <name> [OF|IN <library>] [REPLACING ...] .                                                                                  
                                                                  
  There is no code anywhere in the project that recognizes the EXEC SQL INCLUDE syntax (e.g., EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA END-EXEC). A
  grep for EXEC SQL across the entire src/ directory returns zero matches.

  What would be needed

  To support EXEC SQL INCLUDE, the resolver would need to:

  1. Add a pattern to match EXEC SQL INCLUDE <name> END-EXEC
  2. Resolve the included member the same way copybooks are resolved (search in copybook directories with known extensions)
  3. Replace the EXEC SQL INCLUDE ... END-EXEC block with the inlined content
  4. Track line mappings for the included content

  # Refinement
  Do you think that to resolve EEC SQL INCLUDE is a logical thing for this API?

  # Response
  Yes, it's a logical fit. Here's why:                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                   
  Functionally equivalent to COPY                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                   
  EXEC SQL INCLUDE <member> END-EXEC does the same thing as COPY — it inlines external source code at that point. The DB2          
  precompiler resolves it before compilation, just as the COBOL compiler resolves COPY statements. From the perspective of static  
  analysis (which is what this tool does), the two are interchangeable: both are textual inclusion directives that need expansion  
  to see the full program.                                                                                                       

  Common in real-world COBOL

  In practice, enterprise COBOL programs heavily use EXEC SQL INCLUDE for:
  - SQLCA (SQL Communication Area)
  - DCLGEN copybooks (table declarations generated by DB2)
  - Host variable structures shared across programs

  A COBOL program that uses DB2 will often have both COPY and EXEC SQL INCLUDE in the same source. If resolve_copybooks only
  handles COPY, the resolved output is incomplete — you still have unresolved inclusion directives, which means the data division
  tree and variable analysis will miss those declarations.

  Clean API design

  The API is called resolve_copybooks, not resolve_copy_statements. Conceptually, "resolving copybooks" means "inline all
  externally referenced source" — and EXEC SQL INCLUDE is just another mechanism for referencing external source. A user calling
  this API reasonably expects all inclusion directives to be resolved.

  The alternative — a separate resolve_sql_includes API — would be awkward because:
  - Users would need to call both and chain results
  - The line mapping logic would need to compose across two passes
  - The copybook search paths are the same for both

  What I'd recommend

  Add EXEC SQL INCLUDE handling inside the existing CopyResolver class as a second pattern, alongside COPY_PATTERN. The resolved
  output should leave a similar comment marker (e.g., * EXEC SQL INCLUDE SQLCA resolved) for consistency. The rest of the pipeline
  — line mapping, recursive resolution, copybook path search — stays the same.
