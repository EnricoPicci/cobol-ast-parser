You have developed this app following the strategy defined in "claude_generated_docs/cobol-analyzer-strategy.md".

Then you have updated the logic of the app as described in "claude_generated_docs/subordinate-redefines-strategy.md".

Now you have to improve the app with a nice CLI.

I want a command that take the following parameters and the kicks off the analysis:
- path to the Cobol file to analyze
- path to the output directory (create it if not present)

Add other parameters that you feel are usefull but give them a reasonable default.
In the output file add also the time that the execution took.

Generate a quickstart document that explains how to quickstart the app.
Generate a CLI reference document.
