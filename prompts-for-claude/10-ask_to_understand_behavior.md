Running the command "cobol-analyzer analyze-and-filter complex-cobol-source/TRANPROC.cbl -v TRAN-CUSTOMER-ID -o output" I would expct to see several "affected_records" linked to the variable "TRAN-CUSTOMER-ID" since this variable changes at line 132. At minimum I would have to see the ancestor of the record where "TRAN-CUSTOMER-ID" is defined. However the file produced "TRANPROC-variable-filter.json" does not show any value in the affected record. Explain why.
